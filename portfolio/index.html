        <p>
          Programming is a recent love for me, I have been learning to program
          for the past 2 years and grow to love it more each day.

          Competed in a Hackathon during my final semester in college, while we
          didn't place it was an amazing learning experience and we did receive
          honorable mention.
        </p>
        <p>
          Graduated with <strong>Magna Cum Laude</strong> honors which was quite the
          accomplishment for me considering I didn't even finish high school!

        <h2><em>Hobbies</em></h2>
        <img src="images/golf.jpeg" alt="picture of a long drive I hit, 344 yards">
        <p>
          Golf is pretty much what I think about 24/7. <span style="border: thin solid blue; background-color: aqua;">If its sunny outside I
            want to be on the golf course.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          Working out has been a hobby of mine all of my adult life. Nothing
          feels better than hitting a new PR in the gym.
